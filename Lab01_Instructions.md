# Welcome to Lab01 and variables!

### Variables

In this lab, you will use variables and the input() function in Python.

## Notes 
### Using `input()`

Remember our input function from class? We can use it to take in user input and store it in a variable. It looks like this:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
```

>In this example, the variable `name` is assigned the value of whatever the user types in response to the prompt "What is your name? ".

Try writing in your own file and running it. See what happens!

### Variables

Speaking of variables, let's talk about them. Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.

In Python, we can assign a value to a variable like this:

```python
num_of_burgers = 5
my_name = "Jason Douglas"
are_you_hungry = True
```

We'll be getting into all the different kinds of data types in Python in the coming weeks, but for now, let's focus on the basics.

|A | Cashier Bot|
|B  | Math | 

### Part A ~ **Cashier Bot**

In this scenario, you are writing a program to be the cashier at Iggy's Diner. ~~*rip The Habit :\(*~~

First, write a line of code to ask the customer their name and save it to a variable. You can use the input function from above.

Next, have your code repeat the customer's name back to them **and** ask for their drink order. Write another line of code that does the same but asks for their meal order. Make sure to have their drink and their meal to separate orders.

Finally, have your cashier-bot print out their order and thank the customer using their name. (I.E "Thank you President . You ordered a large Coke and an Iggy Melt. ~~Can I have a raise?~~)
