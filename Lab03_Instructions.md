# Welcome to Lab03 and Conditionals!

### Data Types

In this lab, you will use conditionals in Python.

## Notes 
### Conditionals
Here is an example of a conditional in Python:
```python
name = "Cashier-Bot"

if name == "Cashier-Bot":
    print("Hey bot! How are ya?")
elif name == "Douglas":
    print("woah, a human")
else:
    print("Hello?? Anyone here?")

```

Now, you can do more than just use print statements. You can run any code inside an if statement. This could be something like `x = x * 5` or `name=("Who are you??")`.
